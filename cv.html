						<h4>Who I am</h4>
						<p>I am an enthusiastic, hardworking recent web development graduate with a natural aptitude for learning code, and I am looking forward to making a name for myself in the world of web development. I am interested in learning more about server side code, front end code and frameworks. Ideally I would like to gain experience in an environment where I can learn alongside more experienced developers so I can expand my knowledge of code and industry best practices. I hope to learn a lot more in the future. I have developed a minimalist aesthetic for the projects I have worked on so far, but I am happy to learn whatever processes are the norm in a workplace development environment. I hope to develop my skills and work towards becoming a mid-level developer, and after that the sky’s the limit! </p>

						<h4>Education</h4>
						<p>Diploma of Web Development (Level 6) from the Yoobee School of Design.<br>
						Graduated 8th December 2016<br><br>
						I found that I picked up programing concepts faster than many of the other students in the class, and I enjoyed the work, and tended to get it done fairly quickly.</p>

						<h4>Experience</h4>
						<h5>Sophisticated Pedagogical Practice</h5>
						<a class="cv" href="http://sophisticatedpedagogicalpractice.nz/">http://sophisticatedpedagogicalpractice.nz/</a>
						<p>Developed using Laravel, Sophisticated Pedagogical Practice is a website intended to help a client develop her forthcoming book by allowing her to present and revise work in progress chapters of the book, and receive comments from approved users known to the client. The site was designed to only allow comments from people given approval by the client to post comments on the site. I developed a system where a new user would be informed that they would receive an email informing them if they had been approved. By clicking an approval button next to the name of the user on the user approval page, an email would automatically be sent to the user informing them that they had been approved and could now comment on the website. The client also wanted basic word processing tools, in particular the ability to add charts. This functionality was added via tiny MCE integration, which also added the ability to easily embed YouTube videos into posts and hotlink images from around the web.</p>
						<p>Full back end functionality was developed with Laravel, the site was designed mobile first, and is fully responsive. I’m proud of the automatic email based password reset function. The site was inspired by Scandinavian minimalist sites I was researching at the time.</p><br>

						<h5>Hope Springs</h5>
						<a class="cv" href="http://matthew.chamberlain.yoobee.net.nz/_Assignments/WE03/public_html/index.php">http://matthew.chamberlain.yoobee.net.nz/_Assignments/WE03/public_html/index.php</a>
						<p>Hope springs is a basic web forum for survivors of sexual abuse. It is a simple site with a bootstrap frontend and a hand coded PHP backend. The challenging thing about developing the site was writing a complete CRUD enabled backend in pure PHP and finding all the bugs. This challenge taught me a lot about PHP and MySQL. This site was my first attempt at making a content management system from scratch.</p><br>

						<h5>Oh Green September</h5>
						<a class="cv" href="https://mattchambo.github.io/oh-green-september/index.html">https://mattchambo.github.io/oh-green-september/index.html</a>
						<p>Oh Green September is my first responsive website. It is a site to show off my poetry, music and art, and to reflect my hopeful, determined, nature loving personality. The site contains a modified jQuery image slider plugin and JavaScript form validation, but the form itself is not connected to a server.</p>

						<h4>Interests</h4>
						<p>I make electronic music; I make my own art, I write poetry, and occasionally play video games. I’m also interested in science, economics, politics and philosophy. I read a lot of books, and spend a lot of time reading about current events online.</p><hr>
